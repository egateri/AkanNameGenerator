#### About this project
Akan Name Generator is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculate the day of the week they were born and then based on their gender outputs their Akan Name.

[Akan names][1] are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.

To develop the web application, [JavaScript][4] programming language, Hyper Text Mark up Language ([HTML][2]) and Cascading Style Sheets ([CSS][3]) language have been used.
